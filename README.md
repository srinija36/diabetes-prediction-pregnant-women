# diabetes-prediction-pregnant-women
# Overview
Built a machine learning system to predict diabetes in pregnant women using clinical and demographic data.
The project focuses on data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation to support early risk detection in healthcare.

# Key Highlights

Processed and analyzed 1,000+ medical records

Built an end-to-end ML pipeline from data cleaning to evaluation

Implemented binary classification for diabetes prediction

Designed with real-world healthcare use cases in mind

# Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Version Control: GitHub

# Dataset

Excel-based dataset containing health metrics of pregnant women

# Features include:

Pregnancies

Glucose Level

Blood Pressure

BMI

Insulin

Age

Target:

# Outcome → Diabetic (1) / Non-Diabetic (0)

# Workflow

Data ingestion and validation

Missing value handling and feature scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training using Logistic Regression

Performance evaluation on unseen test data

Results

Achieved strong predictive performance on test data

Model effectively identifies diabetic vs non-diabetic cases

Demonstrates practical application of ML in healthcare analytics
